## Resource Monitor Windows Fundamentals 2

**Description:**  
This lab focused on using Windows Resource Monitor to observe real-time system resource usage, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. The exercises demonstrated how to identify resource-intensive processes and diagnose potential performance issues.  

**Skills Learned:**  
- Monitoring system performance in real-time  
- Identifying resource-intensive processes  
- Understanding CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization  
- Using Resource Monitor to diagnose performance or network issues  

**Key Commands/Concepts:**  
- **CPU tab** – shows CPU usage per process and overall utilization; threads used by each process (e.g., `searchui.exe` using most threads)  
- **Memory tab** – displays total, used, and available memory; charts track memory usage over time  
- **Disk tab** – shows disk activity per process and overall throughput; identify high disk usage  
- **Network tab** – monitors network activity per process (sent/received bits/sec); example: 3300 bits/sec sent, 4800 bits/sec received  

**Outcome:**  
Successfully monitored real-time system resources, identified active processes consuming CPU, memory, disk, and network resources, and evaluated system performance using Resource Monitor.  

**Artifacts:**  
- Notes and screenshots stored in `images/` folder
