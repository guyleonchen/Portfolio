## Using `grep` with Absolute Paths Linux Fundamentals 1

**Description:**  
This lab focused on using the `grep` command to search for specific text patterns in files using absolute paths. It demonstrates how to efficiently locate information without navigating through directories manually.  

**Skills Learned:**  
- Searching for text patterns in files with `grep`  
- Using absolute file paths to target files directly  
- Understanding how to filter outputs for efficient data retrieval  

**Key Commands/Concepts:**  
- `grep "text" /absolute/path/to/file` â€“ search for a string in a specific file  
- Absolute path usage avoids the need to `cd` into directories before searching  

**Examples from Lab:**  
- `grep "THM" /home/tryhackme/access.log`  
  - Searches the file `access.log` for the string `"THM"` using the absolute path  

**Outcome:**  
Successfully located specific text in a file using `grep` and absolute paths, demonstrating efficient file searching and text pattern recognition on the Linux command line.
