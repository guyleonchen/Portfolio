## CLI Creating and Moving Files â€“ Linux Fundamentals 2

**Description:**  
This lab demonstrates basic Linux CLI skills: creating files, moving them between folders, and deleting files. It emphasizes foundational file system management tasks using command-line operations in Linux.  

**Skills Learned:**  
- Creating directories (mkdir)  
- Creating empty files (touch)  
- Moving files between folders (mv)  
- Deleting files (rm)  
- Navigating directories (cd, pwd)  
- Using ~ to reference the home directory  

**Steps Taken:**  
1. Create Folders  
mkdir ~/github/1  
mkdir ~/github/2  
Created two folders, 1 and 2, in the home github directory  

2. Create Files  
a) Empty File  
touch deleteme.txt  
Created an empty file in the current folder  
Verified with: ls -1  

b) Another Empty File  
touch moveme.txt  
Created another empty file  
Verified with: ls -1  

3. Move Files Between Folders  
mv ~/github/1/moveme.txt ~/github/2/  
Moved moveme.txt from folder 1 to folder 2  
Verified with: ls -1 ~/github/2  

4. Move Files Back  
mv ~/github/2/moveme.txt ~/github/1/  
Moved the file back to folder 1  
Verified with: ls -1 ~/github/1  

5. Delete Files  
rm ~/github/1/deleteme.txt  
Deleted the empty file deleteme.txt  
Verified with: ls -1 ~/github/1  

**Outcome:**  
Successfully practiced creating directories, managing files, moving them between folders, and deleting files using Linux command-line tools.
